Network Change Logging Scripted Tool

Summary:
I've created a scripted logging tool using CMD Batch to address any network setup changes with the machine it's running on by pulling IP Configuration lines. The tool was created using CMD Batch to be as lightweight as possible. I was last working on a remote deployment feature to monitor multiple machines using PStools suite integration. The remote feature has not yet been completed as I have left the position it was intended it to assist in.
